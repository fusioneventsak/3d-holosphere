This appears to be a diff for a React component file, but I don't see the original file content that contains the section being modified. The diff shows changes to a form control section, but without the surrounding context of where this code exists in the original file, I cannot generate the complete resulting file content.

Please provide:
1. The complete original file content that contains the section being modified
2. The location/context where this form control code exists in that file

This will allow me to properly merge the changes and generate the complete, correct file content.
