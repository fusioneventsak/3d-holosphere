The diff appears to be trying to modify a component that doesn't exist in the original file content. The original file contains a 3D scene implementation with Three.js components, but the diff seems to be targeting a settings UI component with color and style changes.

Since the diff is targeting code that doesn't exist in the original file, I cannot generate a modified version. The original file should remain unchanged since none of the diff changes are applicable to the actual code present.

To properly apply these changes, you would need to:
1. Locate the correct settings component file that contains the UI elements being modified
2. Apply the dark theme styling changes to that file instead
3. Leave this Three.js scene implementation file as-is

Would you like me to help locate the correct file for these UI theme changes, or would you prefer to keep the current Three.js scene implementation unchanged?
